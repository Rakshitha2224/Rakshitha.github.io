        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the University at Albany. Previously, I worked as a Quality Assurance Intern at MassMutual India, where I gained experience in manual and automation testing and worked with SQL. Over time, I discovered my passion for development—especially frontend and Java-based projects—where I can blend logic with creativity. I enjoy building user-friendly, responsive applications and continuously exploring new technologies that make ideas come alive through code. For me, development is all about learning, experimenting, and creating something meaningful with every project.
